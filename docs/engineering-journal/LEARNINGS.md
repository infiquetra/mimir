### ESI removed GET /search/; POST /universe/ids/ is the supported replacement

**Author.** Qwen Code
**Context.** The Market Browser's default tab could never return a result, and
the Intel watch-list dialog had no way to resolve names at all.
**Evidence.** `curl 'https://esi.evetech.net/latest/search/?categories=inventory_type&search=tritanium'`
returns 404. `POST /universe/ids/` with `["Jita","Amarr"]` returns
`{"systems":[{"id":30000142,"name":"Jita"},...]}`; with `["Tritanium"]` it
returns `inventory_types:[{"id":34,...}]`.
**Mechanism.** The standalone public search route was withdrawn from ESI.
`/universe/ids/` is the supported public name-resolution endpoint and returns
category-keyed maps; it matches whole names, not substrings.
**Fix.** 6b2e06d (market search: SDE substring first, `/universe/ids/` to
augment), d903ff9 (watch-list name resolution).
**Validation.** Provider tests plus live curl against the running endpoint.
**What surprised.** The solar-system key is `systems`, not `solar_systems`.
**Generalizable rule.** Verify an EVE endpoint against the live service before
building on it; a 404 can sit behind a green build for months.

### Golden tests race async providers; pin the providers, do not add a tolerance

**Author.** Qwen Code
**Context.** The Skills goldens failed roughly half of full-suite runs with
"Pixel test failed, 0.00%, 3px diff" yet passed every time in isolation.
**Evidence.** The isolated diff image contained a single speck at the top bar,
where the unallocated-SP value renders; `unallocatedSpProvider` logs showed it
resolving during the capture window.
**Mechanism.** FutureProviders resolve on a pump phase that shifts with the
tests that ran earlier in the same process, so the capture sometimes caught the
top bar mid-resolution.
**Fix.** ce94c20 pins unallocatedSp, totalSkillPoints and queueStats to fixed
AsyncValues for both Skills goldens.
**Validation.** Ten consecutive full-suite runs green.
**What surprised.** A `LocalFileComparator` subclass with a percentage tolerance
made *every* golden fail with "Could not be compared against non-existent
file": the wrapper's `getGoldenBytes` threw before its tolerance logic ran.
That attempt was reverted.
**Generalizable rule.** Make golden inputs deterministic at the provider level;
comparison tolerances treat the symptom and can break golden path resolution.
**Refs.** ce94c20.

### Drift watch() streams do not emit inside bare test() containers here

**Author.** Qwen Code
**Context.** Provider-level tests for saved fittings awaited
`savedFittingsProvider(null).future` and timed out at 30s, while the identical
providers behave under `testWidgets`.
**Evidence.** TimeoutException plus "StreamProvider ... disposed during loading
state, yet no value could be emitted" in
test/features/fitting/presentation/fitting_save_load_test.dart before the fix.
**Mechanism.** Not fully root-caused; the first stream emission never arrives
under the plain test zone in this project's setup.
**Fix.** 959808b asserts persistence through one-shot repository reads
(`getFittings`), and `saveCurrent` resolves the active character with
`characterRepository.getActiveCharacter()` instead of the character stream.
**Validation.** Six fast, stable provider tests.
**Generalizable rule.** In provider unit tests prefer one-shot reads; keep
stream assertions in widget tests where a binding drives the loop.
**Refs.** 959808b.

### ReorderableListView.onReorderItem pre-adjusts newIndex

**Author.** Qwen Code
**Context.** Migrating off the deprecated `onReorder` looked mechanical.
**Evidence.** Flutter SDK reorderable_list.dart: the `onReorder` path passes the
raw drop index while `onReorderItem` passes the index computed after removing
the dragged item.
**Mechanism.** Keeping the app's historical `if (newIndex > oldIndex) newIndex -= 1`
correction on top of the pre-adjusted index shifts every downward drag one slot
early, silently corrupting plan order.
**Fix.** 9d221e2 removes the manual correction with a comment saying why.
**Generalizable rule.** When a deprecation changes a callback's parameter
semantics, read the SDK call site before migrating.
**Refs.** 9d221e2.

### TestApp rendered Flutter's default light theme while the app ships dark

**Author.** Qwen Code
**Context.** Every golden and integration test rendered a theme no user sees.
**Evidence.** sub_window_app.dart hardcodes `AppTheme.darkTheme()`; the
regenerated light-theme Industry golden showed a white-on-white "No Industry
Jobs" empty state.
**Mechanism.** TestApp's MaterialApp declared no theme, so tests got Flutter's
light default.
**Fix.** 9d221e2 sets `AppTheme.darkTheme()` in TestApp and regenerates all
baselines in the shipped theme.
**Validation.** Dark baselines reviewed visually; contrast problems became
visible instead of hidden.
**Generalizable rule.** A test harness must render the shipped theme, or the
suite validates a product that does not exist.
**Refs.** 9d221e2.

### macOS Flutter sub-windows need explicit plugin and config boundaries

**Author.** Codex
**Context.** Combat Analyzer runs as a desktop sub-window. Several failures
looked like UI or scanner bugs, but the root cause was sub-window/plugin
boundary behavior on macOS.

**Evidence.** The recovery checkpoint recorded two concrete faults:
`shared_preferences` produced a sub-window plugin-channel error, and the folder
picker did nothing until native plugin registration was added for
`desktop_multi_window` sub-windows. The scanner later moved selected directory
state into app-support `combat_analyzer.json` instead of relying on
`SharedPreferences`.

**Mechanism.** Each desktop sub-window has its own Flutter engine. Plugins that
work in the main engine are not automatically safe in sub-windows unless the
native side registers them for that engine. Config needed by sub-windows should
also live in a file/database surface the sub-window can read directly.

**Fix.** Register generated plugins for macOS sub-windows and use
app-support JSON for Combat Analyzer config.

**Validation.** Folder selection started working from the Combat Analyzer
window, and scanner state loaded from the saved config instead of getting stuck
behind "scanner not ready" behavior.

**Generalizable rule.** For multi-window Flutter desktop features, assume
plugin registration and state access are per-engine concerns. Prefer database
or app-support files for cross-window state, and verify native plugin
registration for any UI action launched from a sub-window.

**Refs.** `.codex/plans/2026-05-20-combat-analyzer-recovery.md`.

### EVE gamelog folders are mostly non-combat and need cached classification

**Author.** Codex
**Context.** The initial log scanner found many files but either showed
non-combat events or appeared empty depending on directory and parser readiness.

**Evidence.** The recovery checkpoint recorded
`/Users/jefcox/Documents/EVE/logs/Gamelogs` with 1,419 timestamped gamelog
files, but only 56 classified as combat logs and 1,363 classified as
non-combat. Those 56 combat logs produced 295 displayable encounters.

**Mechanism.** EVE gamelogs include timestamped files for many client events,
not just combat. Filename shape proves "EVE gamelog", not "combat log".
Scanning every historical file on startup is wasteful, and showing every
timestamped file pollutes the AAR list with skill redemption and other
non-combat events.

**Fix.** Filter by actual combat-damage content and persist a classification
cache keyed by file path, modified time, and size. Cap initial scans to newest
files and recheck changed files.

**Validation.** Combat Analyzer loaded only combat-bearing logs, and unchanged
non-combat files were skipped on refresh without rereading their contents.

**Generalizable rule.** Treat game-log filename patterns as a broad source
filter only. Use content classification plus a file fingerprint cache before
building UI or sending data to AI.

**Refs.** `.codex/plans/2026-05-20-combat-analyzer-recovery.md`;
`tasks/todo.md`.

### Combat logs are a primary source but not a complete AAR evidence source

**Author.** Codex
**Context.** The combat analyzer initially produced useful AAR prose from EVE
combat logs, but reports still had many unknowns even after zKill/killmail
matching. The user wanted a path to resolve those unknowns instead of having
the AI guess.

**Evidence.** AAR enrichment implementation added
`lib/features/combat_analyzer/domain/combat_evidence_ledger.dart`,
`combat_fit_snapshot_mapper.dart`, `combat_damage_matchup.dart`, and v3 prompt
payload support in `lib/features/combat_analyzer/data/codex_analysis_client.dart`.
Focused checks passed:
`flutter test test/features/combat_analyzer test/features/fitting/domain/format_parser_test.dart`
and
`dart analyze lib/features/combat_analyzer lib/features/fitting/domain/format_parser.dart test/features/combat_analyzer test/features/fitting/domain/format_parser_test.dart`.

**Mechanism.** EVE combat logs prove event timing, damage lines, hits, misses,
weapons, and actors seen by the local client. They do not contain range,
transversal, tank layer depletion, pilot intent, historical pilot fit, full
opponent fit, or all ship/dogma modifiers. Killmails add destroyed-fit and
attacker/victim context, but they still do not prove the surviving pilot's fit
or the live range/application situation.

**Fix.** Added an evidence ledger and fit evidence model so AARs can separate
proven facts, user-confirmed facts, reference snapshots, derived facts, and
open unknowns. Added manual EFT/DNA fit import and current active ship snapshot
capture as explicit evidence-gathering paths.

**Validation.** Domain tests cover ledger serialization, current-ship asset
snapshot mapping, damage matchup classification, and SDE-backed EFT parsing.
Combat analyzer tests plus fitting parser tests pass.

**What surprised.** zKill/killmail enrichment reduced some unknowns but did
not eliminate the highest-value one for learning: the pilot's actual fit at
fight time.

**Generalizable rule.** Treat each EVE source as evidence with scope and
confidence. Do not let the AI collapse "unknown" into narrative certainty;
surface the missing evidence and give the user a way to resolve it.
